This notebook is part of a machine learning project for second-year computer science students at HIT.
It explores a dataset of wines and implements KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) and Decision Tree algorithms to determine the most effective machine learning approach for this dataset.
The goal is to analyze and compare the performance of these algorithms in classifying wines based on their attributes.
