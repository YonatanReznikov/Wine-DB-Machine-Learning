# Wine-DB-Machine-Learning
## Overview

This notebook is part of a machine learning project for second-year computer science students at HIT.
It explores a dataset of wines and implements KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) and Decision Tree algorithms to determine the most effective machine learning approach for this dataset.
The goal is to analyze and compare the performance of these algorithms in classifying wines based on their attributes.


## Project Description

In this project, we delve into the world of wine, utilizing machine learning to classify wine quality based on chemical properties. The primary goals are:

- To understand the relationship between chemical attributes and wine quality.
- To build and evaluate machine learning models for wine quality classification.
- To implement and compare different machine learning algorithms on the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Wine Quality Data Set**, which contains various chemical properties of wine samples and their quality ratings.

- **Attributes**: pH, alcohol, density, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and others.
- **Target**: Quality rating of wine (score between 0 and 10).

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following:

- **Jupyter Notebook**/ **Google Colab**/ **VS Code**.
- **Valid Internet Connection**: Required for downloading dependencies and accessing the dataset.
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
